# SuperClip
A small tool that lets you copy many values and paste whichever you want

It stores values in the buttons 0-9 (the ones above the letters).
To copy into a button, press CTRL + SHIFT + the button.
To paste the value, press only CTRL + the button.

Written in C, you just have to compile the program and run it.
To close it, end its process from the Task Manager (for now anyways...)

I'm pretty new so feel free to comment or to tell me better ways to do this
